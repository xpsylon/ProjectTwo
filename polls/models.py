'''In our poll app, weâ€™ll create two models: Question and Choice. A Question has a question and a publication date. A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally. Each Choice is associated with a Question.
These concepts are represented by Python classes. Edit the polls/models.py file so it looks like this:'''

class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField('fecha publicacion')

class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
