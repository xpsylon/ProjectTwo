    '''This is a method definition for the was_published_recently() method of a class.

This method checks whether the pub_date attribute of the object is within the last 24 hours, and returns a boolean value indicating whether it was published recently or not.

The method uses the >= operator to compare the pub_date attribute of the object to the result of subtracting one day (datetime.timedelta(days=1)) from the current time (timezone.now()), which is a timezone-aware datetime object representing the current date and time.

If the pub_date attribute is greater than or equal to the result of subtracting one day from the current time, then the method returns True, indicating that the object was published recently. Otherwise, it returns False.

It's important to note that the timezone.now() function is used to get the current date and time in the timezone of the Django project. This ensures that the comparison is accurate and takes into account any timezone differences.'''
